# üè† Bui Trong Nghia - Home Assignment

A cleanly architected Flutter project demonstrating scalable app development practices using modern tools and patterns. This project emphasizes maintainability, testability, and developer experience.

---

## üì± Project Overview

This app is structured with modularity and scalability in mind. It leverages advanced Flutter development techniques such as:

- Declarative UI with **Flutter**
- **Hooks + Riverpod** for reactive state management
- **AutoRoute** for elegant, type-safe routing
- **Dio** for robust API handling
- **Freezed** and **JsonSerializable** for clean data modeling
- **Geolocator** and **Geocoding** for location-based features
- Environment variable support with **flutter_dotenv**
- Functional programming utilities with **Dartz**

## üß± Project Architecture

The project follows a **Clean Architecture** pattern to ensure separation of concerns. Layers are divided into:

- **Presentation** (UI layer with Hooks + Riverpod)
- **Application / State Management** (ViewModels / Providers)
- **Domain** (entities)
- **Data** (repositories, APIs, models)

This layered approach allows easy testing and low coupling between modules.
